    "\n",
    "A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.\n",

    "**Common git commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "- List all of the branches in your repository: ```git branch``` (same as ```git branch --list```)\n",
    "- Create a new branch (does not check out the new branch): ```git branch <branch>```\n",
    "- Delete a specified branch: ```git branch -d <branch>``` (\"safe\" operation in that Git prevents you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes)\n",
    "- Force delete a specified branch: ```git branch -D <branch>``` (use if you want to permanently throw away all of the commits associated with a particular line of development)\n",

    "\n",
    "Git rebase is an alternative to merge that integrates changes from one branch into another. Unlike merging, which creates a new commit combining histories, rebasing moves the entire branch to a new starting point, making the commit history linear.\n",

    "*When to use rebase?*\n",
    "- To keep a clean, linear history (especially in feature branches)\n",
    "- When you want to update your branch with the latest changes from the ```main``` before merging. \n",
    "- To resolve conflics interactively before integrating changes.\n",
    "- Use rebase when your branch is behind ```main``` and you want to put your changes on top. \n",

    "Steps\n",
    "- Switch to your feature branch: ```git checkout -b feature-branch```\n",
    "- Make some changes to the notebook (i.e. add a small statement like \"Testing the rebase function\"), then add and commit the modifications. \n",

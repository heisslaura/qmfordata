    "A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.\n",

    "- Force delete a specified branch: ```git branch -D <branch>``` (use if you want to permanently throw away all of the commits associated with a particular line of development)\n",
